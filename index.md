I am an academic, currently in my fifth year PhD in Applied Statistics at the University of California, Riverside. I have been a physicist, astronomer, and now a statistician. I am interested in mathematical modeling and curious about understanding various physical phenemenon. I want to work in the frontier of data science and use my skills to tell exciting stories with data.

## Current Interests and Projects:
